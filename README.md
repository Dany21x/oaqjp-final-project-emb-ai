# Emotion Detection Web Application

## Final Project: Course "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask"

This project is part of the course "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask", where basic Python skills are applied to develop AI-enabled applications. In this hands-on course, I took on the role of a developer and performed the following tasks:

- Developed functions and application logic.
- Exchanged data using Watson AI libraries.
- Wrote unit tests.
- Packaged the application for distribution.

### Project Description

The goal of this final project was to build an emotion detection application based on text analysis using Flask and IBM Watson AI libraries. The project includes:

1. **Integration with Watson AI:** Watson libraries were incorporated to perform emotional analysis of the text provided by the user.
2. **Unit testing and error handling:** Unit tests were implemented to ensure the correct functionality of the application, along with exception handling for robustness.
3. **Packaging and distribution:** The application was packaged and prepared for distribution.

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** The main language used for application logic.
- **Flask:** Framework used for developing the web application.
- **IBM Watson AI:** AI libraries used to perform emotion and sentiment analysis.
- **Pytest:** Tool used to write and run unit tests.
